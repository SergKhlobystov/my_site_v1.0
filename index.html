            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I decided to become a programmer and developer because simply consuming content or even creating it as a designer was no longer enough for me. I thrive on solving problems, coming up with innovative solutions, and bringing diverse projects to life as part of a team.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Continuous learning excites me, and I am always eager to explore new technologies and improve my skills. My goal is to build meaningful and efficient solutions that make a difference.</p>
